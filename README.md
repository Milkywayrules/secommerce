# secommerce (Super E-Commerce)

This contains backend folder for the Backend App and frontend folder for the Frontend App. Secommerce using Strapi for the core of his CMS and using Nuxtjs + Tailwindcss for the UI and the UX.

Secommerce just my excercise project for increase the understanding how the Strapi + Nuxtjs works. And maybe i'll add GrapQL later on.
