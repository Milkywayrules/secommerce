# secommerce (Super E-Commerce)

This repo contains backend folder for the Backend App and frontend folder for the Frontend App. Secommerce using Strapi for the core of his CMS and using Nuxtjs + Tailwindcss for the UI and the UX.

Secommerce is just one of my excercise project, the purpose is for increasing the understanding how the Strapi + Nuxtjs works. And maybe i'll add GrapQL later on.
